# Code-Quiz
## Purpose
This website is a code quiz designed to help reinforce the fundamentals of Javascript.
## Functionality
This website takes the time and uses it as the score for whenever you are finished answering the questions.
Every question you get wrong subtracts 10 seconds from the timer.
At the end, you put in your initials and save your highscore (and it persists after reload).
